# Brian Connor's amazing journey through the hiring exercise

## Notes on setup
* I was able to install vagrant and the datadog agent with no trouble
* I confirmed that the agent was reporting by looking at the host map page
* Out of curiousity, I also installed an agent in my osx terminal, hoping that I'd get data from two hosts to compare.  I'm showing two dogbones in my toolbar (picture below) and am showing both agents running successfully in the terminal but only one host is showing on the map (the linux agent that I started first is reporting).  I'm assuming this setup just isn't the intended use case so I'm going to leave it for now for the sake of completing the task, but I'm interested to circle back to this question later.
